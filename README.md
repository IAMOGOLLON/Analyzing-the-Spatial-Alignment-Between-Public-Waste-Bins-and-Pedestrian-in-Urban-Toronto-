# Analyzing the Spatial Alignment Between Public Waste Bins and Pedestrian Mobility in Urban Toronto

## Project Overview
This is a **group project** focused on analyzing the spatial alignment between:
- public waste bin distribution
- pedestrian mobility patterns
- transit accessibility
- population context  
within the City of Toronto.

The objective is to evaluate whether waste bins are spatially aligned with areas of high pedestrian activity and urban demand, using geospatial analysis techniques in Python.

...

## Project Scope
The analysis integrates multiple spatial and contextual layers:
- Waste bin locations
- Pedestrian proxy datasets (sidewalks, activity indicators)
- Public transit access points
- Population and demographic context

All spatial processing, validation, and analysis are performed using **Python (GeoPandas, Shapely, Pandas, NumPy)** in VS Code / Jupyter Notebooks.
